FinancialMapReduce
==================

Some examples of using financial data in MapReduce programs.  The programs find each stock's all time high/low and a give day's high/low.  Use the dataset from InfoChimps http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/nasdaq-exchange-daily-1970-2010-open-close-high-low-and-volume.  Be sure to delete the dividends files.
